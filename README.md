# Aider - AI pair programming assistant that actually work

In this video tutorial, we will build a FastAPI application with Nexjs as frontend inside a docker container. We will also use docker-compose to manage the services.

We will not write any code for this application because aider will generate everything for us.

## Installation

```bash
pip install aider
```

```
cd app
docker compose up
```
